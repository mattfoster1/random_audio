# random_audio

So this one is a little harder to explain.

I really like the old visual style of the visualiser/display on 90s stereo amplifiers.
I remember sitting and watching them go up in time to the music. Would the middle one go higher than before? 
I dunno. I guess some of you had more fun stuff happening. Let's not dwell on that.

Anyway, it looked a bit like this: https://ak9.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/5417423/thumb/1.jpg

I set this system up to simulate that visualiser, but.... without any actual audio input.
Every line's height is generated by an RNG, but with a multiplier tacked on that relates to a few of the lines before it. 
That way you get rough (but still clear) curves and patterns in the output.

I was so flippin proud when I cracked this, but it was really hard to explain to my (not-developer) flatmates upon completion.

Oh well. Enjoy!
